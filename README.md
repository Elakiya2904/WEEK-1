# WEEK-1
This project aims to develop an AI system that predicts the cost and driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) using vehicle specifications, trip data, and environmental factors. It combines machine learning models for precise predictions with a GPT-based chatbot that provides users with insights, recommendations, and answers to EV-related queries.
